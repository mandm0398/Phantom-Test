							<p>While a part of UTDâ€™s NanoExplorers Program, I conducted research on integrating nylon-66 artificial muscles into tensegrity structures in order to create adaptable and lightweight robots. Over the course of the 10 week program, my partner and I developed two different styles of tensegrity robots, one based on a sphere and the other based off a snake. These robots functioned due to the fact that, when properly prepared and trained, the nylon-66 artificial muscles contract when an electrical current heats them up which allows them to function as actuators. Due to their compactness and ability to adapt over time to different amounts of stress these muscles create robots capable of deforming to absorb large amounts of force while still returning to their original form.</p>

								<center><h3>1st Prototype</h3></center>
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/Tensegrity/SphereProto.JPG" alt="" width=75% />
									<p>The initial prototype was constructed using chopsticks as the frame as they were readily available and allowed us to very quickly test the concept before beginning refined prototypes. We then integrated four artificial muscles into a sphere-like tensegrity structure while leaving the rest as neutral rubber bands. When the muscles of this mock up were actuated properly it was able to roll over which led us to making a cleaner prototype completely comprised of muscles.</p>

								<center><h3>2nd Prototype</h3></center>
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/Tensegrity/Tensegrity.jpg" alt="" width=75% />
									<p>The revised Icosahedron tensegrity prototype featured designed 3D printed rods which organized the network of muscles and prevented shorting when the muscles were actuated. While this version was able to manipulate itself into different configurations, the nylon artificial muscles proved to not allow enough flexibility to deform to the point of allowing movement. We decided that in order to correct this we could move the mounting point of the muscles lower and loop them over each other to increase the length as longer length results in higher actuation and greater flexibility; however, the deadline for the program was approaching and we did not have enough time to implement a redesign.</p>

							<div class="leftP">
								<center><h3>Living Hinges</h3></center>
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/Mousetrap/LivingHinge.jpg" alt="" width=75% />
									<p>In order to overcome the issue of the speed bumps essentially placing a maximum speed restriction, I integrated living hinges into my design in order to create a suspension system of sorts. The flexibility which these hinges provided allowed the car to ride over the bumps at a much faster speed without losing control. Additionally, the block like nature of the bumps caused many cars to lose their speed when crossing but the living hinge suspension allowed us to bounce over them with minimal losses.</p>

								<center><h3>Large Lightweight Wheels</h3><center>
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/Mousetrap/Wheel.jpg" alt="" width=75% />
									<p>In order to minimize the acceleration needed to reach peak speed, we reduced the mass of the wheels as much as possible to reduce inertial resistance while increasing the diameter to maximize distance per rotation. Because the final design used thin wheels, rubber bands had to be added to the outside in order to increase our traction and avoid spinning out when accelerating.</p>

								<center><h3>Variable Diameter Axle</h3></center>
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/Mousetrap/Axle.jpg" alt="" width=75% />
									<p>Realizing that the living hinges allowed the car to maintain its high speed and therefore not need to continually accelerate after every bump, the axle of the mouse trap was whittled down to allow for a smaller lever arm to exist and resulted in faster angular acceleration.</p>

							<div class="rightP">
								<center><h3>Small Lever</h3></center>
								<span class="image main">
									<img src="images/Mousetrap/LivingHinge.jpg" alt="" width=75% />
									<p>Our mousetrap car featured an extremely small lever arm as its short length resulted in a faster angular velocity. However, this resulted in a very low initial torque to grant acceleration. Using a small arm was only possible due to our lightweight design and variable diameter axle which granted a boost to torque initially.</p>
